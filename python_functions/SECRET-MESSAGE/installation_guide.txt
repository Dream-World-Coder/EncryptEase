	FOR MAC OS AND LINUX:

		First Make sure to give execute permissions to the install.sh file usig 'chmod +x install.sh' command.
		Then run the install.sh file in terminal using './install.sh' command.

		This script assumes the use of apt-get for package management, which is common on Debian-based systems like Ubuntu. 
		If you are using a different package manager, you may need to adjust the script accordingly.



	FOR WINDOWS:

		Run the 'install.bat' file in command prompt. 

		This script uses Chocolatey, a package manager for Windows, to install Python and pip. 
		If you don't have Chocolatey installed, you can follow the instructions on the Chocolatey website to install it.
